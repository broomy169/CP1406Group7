    <h1>AFCM 25th Anniversary Celebration Concert review</h1>
<h2>by Helen Land</h2>

<br>    
<p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately four thousand satis-fied music lovers. This free concert organised to cele-brate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anni-versary with it’s first ever outdoor public perfor-mance. <br><br>

    The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The con-cert opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the perfor-mance by Camerata of St Johns with their virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompa-nied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone perfor-mance with her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.
    <br><br>
1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville with which audiences are familiar. They had the audi-ence tapping their feet to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely was heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel.
<br><br>
    The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant afternoon can only be rated as a huge success and may prove to be the first of many performances in years to come.</p>

    <h1>Twilight Review</h1>
    <h2>by Judy Hunter and photographs by Gai Copeman</h2>
<p>Twilight was a community project to mark the 30th birthday of Dance North. The theme of the performance was sensing sea, sky and earth through connection with place. It involved over 150 performers over more than 14 locations on the beautiful head-land at Jezzine. It was a performance in motion with the audience moving from one location to the next shepherded by volunteer guides.
    <br><br>
The performance began before sunset and continued while the sun went down and the horizon changed colour. The later sta-tions were lit by candles and lighting concealed in the vegetation.
Performances ranged from the Brass members of the Barrier Reef Orchestra who could be found at several stations, through school dance students, to the Forever Young over 60s. It included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance and music groups, Kith and Kin, Aquapel-la, who had just re-turned from a suc-cessful tour to Eu-rope, WASSA, our African drummers and Teepee Parkour who leapt over walls and stairs and were ac-companied by Boris doing amazing stunts of his lit up bicycle.
    <br><br>
In perhaps a first for Townsville one section of the show involved a mobile phone orchestra. The audience were encouraged to download an app on which original music had been recorded and the audience played this on their phones to accompany a record-er solo.
The finale was with the dancers from Dance North and the BRO Brass playing original music composed by the Musical Director, Ng Chor Guan from Malaysia. Guan had composed almost all the music for the production. The overall Artistic and Creative Direc-tion was in the hands of Cheryl Stock AM who was the founding Artistic Director of Dance North from 1985 to 1996.
